# Insurance Loss Analytics Project
The goal of this project is to build data-driven prediction models to support more accurate and risk-sensitive pricing in auto insurance.

## Report
[This Document](/Insurance_Loss_Analytics_Report.pdf) contains the full explanation of our approach, going through the data cleaning, model selection, and interpretation of results for this project.  

## Code
[This Notebook](/Insurance_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb) contains the necessary data processing steps to prepare the raw dataset for use in machine learning models.  
[This Notebook](/Insurance_Combined_Models.ipynb) contains the code for all machine learning models used in the project.
